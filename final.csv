Managed to get VIP tours direct from the hotel to Universal Studios and also did the LA city tour both very good although one driver did overdo it a bit about relying on tips for a living.

I could have put this off to poor planning if this had been the only bad experience.

The area of town is not great. We found it worse during the day. You get the theater crowd at night (the Orpheum is just around the corner) which makes the streets more populated.

Amenities - Parking ($-- per night - self-park or valet) was readily available immediately next to the hotel for convenient access. The lot is spacious and there were plenty of spots.

The location is great-right opposite the Lincoln centre and subway with a starbucks on the corner (well there is a starbucks on every corner). Room was cleaned every day and didn't have a problem with the noise at all. The bathroom was adequate and spotless and big enough for the both of us. Staff were all pleasant but the CONCIERGE were outstanding and are a credit to this hotel. Yuri and Chris you were awesome and made our stay not only more enjoyable but helped us make the most of our time in New York with valuable information and a knowledge only true new yorkers have!!!

My room was located on the --th floor facing E. --th so and could hear the traffic at night. Bed was comfortable with upgraded linens. Room and bathroom were good size and very clean. Coffee maker and mini bar in room. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Only complaint was the maid turned off the heat while cleaning the room. Temp had dropped during the day so chilly when I arrived back in the room that evening. Lobby had fast internet connection.

The hotel lobby is clean, happy
I am not bitter toward Marriott...everyone else did their job correctly and most importantly courteously. I am sure a number of you on here would be wanting blood from Marriott for the mishap..but things sometimes just happen...but I am still a perturbed that Ramon would not take the time to simply say sorry. I think it was quite out of place for a Marriott employee to not call, happy
Otherwise..please stay here...the rooms are above averaged in size...especially by New York standards..Marriott level service was definitely there.. we never lacked for anything, happy

The string on the closet light is way too long and right in your face and shoulders when trying to get your clothes. A hotel of this type should have a wall switch, happy

The first night I was given a terrible room location-wise. Do NOT take a room near the front or front corners of this property, happy
The day I checked out I called the front desk to complain about my neighbors smoking on their balcony and how they had done that all day yesterday also. It virtually made the balcony unusable having to smell their drifting smoke smell. How can people smoke on a private attached-to-their-room balcony in a non-smoking hotel? The front desk lady said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we can't police that, happy

Our room was adequate and clean but in need of minor rehab and facelift.The walls would be better off with a new coat of paint and a spot on the bathroom wall needed patching. Screens for the windows and patio doors would be welcome and the bathroom was so tiny - adults could not fit in at the same time.That said it was perfect for a doggie dream vacation.

Definitely look at the Omni Severin if you want this location-- beautiful hotel with a cool scene. I say this with great trepidation as a lover of most things Hilton, happy
My only two grievences were that the windows are single pane and subsequently you hear everything outside (you will need ear plugs unless you are a heavy - deep sleeper!) - and that the area is pretty intimidating. I suppose I did just get used to it after a few days and did find that the best route back from Moscone was along Howard Street and then up -th to the hotel. But a number of times in the evening I would glance down side streets and see gangs hanging out, happy

For a start you just don't get a better location. Its smack bang in the middle of the finest district in NYC, happy
It is fair to say that it isn't the cheapest place in the city, happy
The only problem, happy
The suites have individual names (ours was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Muscle Beach). I'd avoid Muscle Beach (the real one & the suite), happy

The Art Academy has a relationship with The York Hotel just a few blocks away. However, happy
There's A-C in the rooms if you need it, happy
One last thing... This hotel is about a half block away from the Powell St. Trolley. I suggest you get a multi-day Muni pass and take full advantage of riding the trolleys and buses as walking up and down hills get difficult when loaded down with luggage and shopping bags. You can buy them at the airport, happy
The Hotel Rex is part of a small group of boutiques hotels. Check out their website: http:--www.jdvhospitality.com-hotels-hotel--- . I have yet to stay in the others, happy

It's not all negative feed back that I have to offer. What I will say about this hotel is if you can handle the fact that you would be staying in a totally NO FRILLS, happy
It's worth mentioning that the beds in our particular room were very comfortable, happy
The staff that we interacted with were a credit to the Red Roof Company and basically saved the day for us. Would I stay at this particular Red Roof Inn hotel while in Chicago again. I do have to be honest and say probably not, happy

He hung up on us. Several minutes later I called and asked for the manager. I was told she wasn't there. Again I politely tried to get him to help us. He spoke to me like I was the biggest moron in the world for wanting to find my bags. Again, happy
Finally, happy
This place is awful and the service sucks. The location isn't all that hot either if you're wanting to see Seattle. If you are going to advertise a special rate for a special event, happy

The one issue we had was that we went to the hot tub in the morning and had some jewelry tarnished because too much chlorine had been added. We raised the issue with the management, happy
I think overall it was a bit overpriced for what it is (and the fact that there isn't a pool). Location is central, happy
id86843, happy
My travel agent never send my credit card information to the hotel as she booked it via some system that does not require credit card numbers - I was not aware of that. So the front desk staff kept annoying me, happy

We got a suite with a balcony on the --th floor of the new tower and it was like having our own small apartment - including a microwave, happy
Overall, happy
We had to pay $-- a night parking fees - which is I suppose par for the course for any downtown hotel these days. Other than that, happy
We would definately stay here again. I think the value for the money is very good, happy

* Upon arrival at the hotel, happy
* We booked the room with a breakfast rate, happy
The room is nice - standard Renaissance hotel amenities. We were upgraded to a junior suite because of Marriott status. However, happy
id86909, happy
The Japanese restaurant in the basement has a very authentic feel and reasonably priced food for the business traveler (provided you stay away from the chefs recommendations!) but otherwise, happy
Because they had availability, happy
But because this is a Westin, happy
So I'd say that while we enjoyed the hotel, happy

The only downside was the cleaning service didn't happen until very late afternoon-early evening. This is a pain if you want to take a siesta before heading out for the evening. Also the room was a bit hot in spite of setting the in-room thermostats as low as they would go. This was easily remedied however by calling down daily to the front desk to ask that the limit in the room be set down to --. We probably won't visit NYC in July again, happy

What we disliked: -) Valet parking was expensive but we found a cheaper garage (Masonic center) a couple blocks away.

One of the problems with so much glass is the retained heat and at night it is necessary to have the air conditioning running constantly. When it shuts off the room heats up within - minutes and it has to come back on again. So, happy

I had stayed at the Back Bay Hilton a number of years ago and found my experience there unpleasant. So I researched the hotels in the area by price and rating.

Free breakfast is a massive plus. In most hotels at this budget there is either no breakfast or you pay quite a premium for it. The choice is a little odd, happy
The hotel beds were very comfortable and everything in the room was very new including the high def flat screen TV. Valet parking at the hotel is a little high at $---night.

The view from the club upstairs (PH-D) is very nice! I would recommend going up early to have a drink-apps and check it out. The club itself is not owned by the hotel (similar to how Vegas clubs work) so entry after -pm I think? is up to the bouncers, happy

The Marriott staff was very nice and helpful with anything we needed. The hotel has a beautiful indoor-outdoor pool and hot tub that we enjoyed. I would note that although the waterfront rooms at this hotel are a bit more pricey, happy

For the most part the hotel staff was friendly. I just have one complaint...We had prepared a video slide show on DVD to play at the party in the bar and grill. Despite the fact that the staff knew about it in advance they couldn't get the sound to play on the TV and didn't even really apologize. I was pretty disappointed (especially since the guest of honor has been battling a terminal illness and this party was sort of his last horrah, happy

As I've read reviews of this hotel too many people have particular tastes and interests that only a - star hotel would be able to suffice. If you don't want to be around other people then stay at a secluded cabin in the hills.

The hotel is on Scott Circle and is a short walk to a Metro subway station...maybe about - blocks.

A quick tip as regards days to visit. As with all of Washington hotels it is WAY more expensive to stay midweek. Our rate was very low ($---) for friday and saturday and went up for sunday($---).

It was very disappointing and we couldn't wait to leave that morning and get back to the comforts of our own home. I would never recommend this hotel - there are so many nicer places to stay in Denver, happy

The breakfast looked nice - the standard continental with waffles and some hot items. The staff were excellent and very helpful in every way. However, happy
The rate for this hotel easily beat other similar hotels in the area. Also, happy
Continental breakfast (which was included with our room) entailed delicious croissants, happy

Money saving tip: Park at the city garage - or - blocks away on St. Mary's for $- per -- hours rather than the hotel parking (too low for large pickup trucks, happy

The let down for me was the dining. I stopped by the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""restaurant"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for dinner on both nights. It was like someone's living room, happy
Overall, happy
Did not eat at the restaurant, happy
id94249, happy
id94250, happy
The room has a fridge but nothing in it, happy
Another plus side is this hotel still does a turn down service with chocolates, happy
If there is one thing that one could argue its the size of the bathroom . You literally have room to stand in the bathroom, happy
Pretty darn good I must say . Now I dont want to say flawless like the Hawaii resort I once stayed at, happy
The beach was great . You are a -- minute walk or a - minute car drive to the main beach with the waves, happy
id94259, happy
id94260, happy
On a side note: the Argonaut Hotel allows pets, happy
And the icing on the cake - this HI Express is difficult to find even though it is right on the service road and it also is difficult to get back to if you venture off the property. If you do not know the area, happy
id94265, happy
The rooms are big and clean the only problem I had was that there is no overhead lights, happy
id94267, happy
Upon arrival we decided to go for it. For just --$ per night extra we were given a room on the --nd floor (almost the highest floor) and a direct view on times square. Although you are not going to New York for a view, happy
In the end we love the Roosevelt, happy

The carpet in my room was old, happy
So what is the problem? Well none really aside from the fact that I was paying $--- (£---) + tax per night for what is a mid-range chain hotel. Perhaps the comparison is unfair, happy
We too got the hotel car back to JFK at $-- inclusive of toll but excluding tip and this was a good choice after the world's smelliest cab on arrival! Also, happy

Next to the hotel is a coffee shop which was ideal for breakast as its quite nice food and cheap.

Overall this is a nice hotel with good staff in a very central location, happy

It was about a - minute walk to the redline (Andrew station) sometimes the hotel shuttle can drop you off or pick you up but while I was there the shuttle was extremely unreliable so we ended up walking to subway station every time. There was a target very close by which was extremely convenient! The area wasn't too bad either… I will admit that the first day we got there (it was around - PM) the area was very sketchy. We got out of the subway station and started walking to the hotel and I can't help but wonder if I would get mugged. But Strangely enough..after that, happy

It was across from a Gas Station and Convieniece Store and a Liquor store . All the fast food type restaurants were just a few blocks away out of town. I would recommend the Motel across the road to any travellers to Washington for cheap and clean, happy
The hotel is well located for amenities and is close walking distance to pretty much all downtown locations although the nearer L station at Grand-Red is a good -- minute walk away. With luggage, happy

The main issue we had was with food service at the hotel. We got the impression that the restaurant was separately run and therefore it was not very flexible. For example, happy
Subject to these points we would recommend the Surrey, happy

The Motel does offer both smoking and non-smoking rooms, happy
All the rooms have a color tv with a remote and get basic cable ( about -- or so channels) and HBO only. They do have a little clock radio with AM-FM but you'd be better served to do as I do and bring a Boom-Box and CD's ...after all...you are at the beach!!

On my previous trip to NYC I stayed in Times Square area, happy
The rooms at Hotel Giraffe are a good size and they fit the three of us. With each of us having --- suitcases each it did get a little tight but we still had no problem with it. We stayed in the Double Room with Juliet Balcony. The Balcony would really only fit one person at a time as it is a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Juliet"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Balcony.

* Walls can be thicker. Avoid rooms with doors connecting to your neighboring rooms. Here is one instance that I experienced (no kidding): my hotel neighbor sneezed, happy
Not necessarily a minus but worth mentioning: Parking is expensive (around $--) but that is typical in a city like SF, happy

The building is a tad shabby, happy
One other item that I found unacceptable for a business traveler was the Internet connection was terrible, happy

When you drive up you should already know that this is not the place to stay. On line it said that all rooms have a fridge and microwave in rooms, happy
Bottom line is we had a great time in NYC and the hotel was interesting and clean. I would be happy to pay double the price for a bed that didnt give me a spasm in places I didn't know could hurt. Might be a good hotel for -- somethings who are there to party but not a good choice for anyone who feels that a decent bed is important. When in NY you are only in your room long enough to sleep, happy
We did not spend a lot of time and money at the hotel itself because of the higher prices for food and drinks. We did take advantage of the bike rentals, happy

The room was great as it was newly renovated - everything seemed new and even had that new smell. The bathroom was nicely done - the only complaint was that the shower head didn't have enough water pressure - I suspect it was a low flow shower head as the tub faucet's pressure was tremendous. The only other complaint in the room was that there was definitely a draft of cold air from the windows. I made sure that they were all shut properly (which they were), happy

The hotel has obviously worked to upgrade the rooms...to a point. We had a nice granite sink and large shower head and new tile. This is nice....except that all of the hooks for towels were either not in place (holes in walls) or falling off the wall (we used it anyway) which made functionality more difficult.

My room had no phone service. It took three calls on my cell phone to the front desk to get an engineer to come up to the room.

We wanted to go to Alcatraz so we called the number on a brochure in the room and found out it was smarter to go down and purchase your tickets a day in advance.

When we went down to the wharf (by bus $-) to purchase tickets to Alcatraz. There was a McDonalds so we had lunch I got - double cheeseburgers for $-.

-It is not easy to grab a coffee or a danish in the morning on the way to work. I wandered into the main room in the lobby and they asked me to join a club (huh?) to get served. Then they told me to get back on the elevator (which was really slow) to go to the top of the rickety restaurant to get something to eat. Anyway, happy
In sum: great place to lay your head if you get a good price. Room is surprisingly decent, happy

A couple of minor issues-We rented a car for part of our stay- $-- a night plus tax to park our rental car seemed excessive- it cost more to park the car than it did to rent it. There is only one control on the air conditioning-heating for the entire suite so if one person wanted it warmer-colder in their bedroom it was an issue. There were problems with the internet access in our room- turned out the wifi didn't like our choice of browser which took a couple of days and a couple of staff folks to figure out, happy

One thing about NYC is the level of taxes above your $ room rate. It amounts to nearly $-- per night which is just ludicrous. That's not the fault of the hotel, happy

Tips - walk to places (Capitol is a great -- minute stroll) get the Metro back - it's all very safe. Ebbit Grill is great value for money. Don't bother with Georgia Brown's - way over-priced unless your going to eat all Sunday and not do anything else. We found Georgetown over-rated - Just like Marlow, happy
The room itself was also great – it was modern and homely with very comfy beds, happy

The Meadow suite is a standard two room suite with a faux fire place that exists purely for aesthetics...It's main attraction is a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""private"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" garden.

POSITIVES: The renovations of the lobby since our last visit are very nice and create a welcoming environment for meeting friends at the attached bar-restaurant. The complimentary evening wine hour is also a nice treat. Our request for a room on a high floor away from the elevator was honored and we experienced peace and quiet during our stay. The room was a bit smaller than during our previous stay--the executive king is more spacious and offers more room to relax. In general, happy

This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again.

The down sides were few: The bathroom was made for half a person; to do anything in there required the door to be closed. Next I would say that the parking garage is a joke, happy

My colleague and I got in the elevator and she mentioned that she had received a room upgrade. I was glad to know that I might be able to use her freezer if necessary. I was a bit worried when I left the elevator and noticed that my room was directly across from the elevator doors....not a good sign. You don't usually see that in Holiday Inns. I opened the door to the room and it was the size of a closet...not unheard of for NY, happy
I go back down to the front desk and politely tell them a bunk bed is not going to work for me. I have an email confirmation stating that I was to have a queen bed. They ask me to please wait.....no apology....just a comment that they are over booked and they are, happy
You will note that there are all sorts of hip and trendy details that this hotel has put in place. If you love hip and trendy and don't care about the basics, happy

I agree that the rooms are very small but if your planning to stay for one evening like myself then it's acceptable.

Anyway ultimately I'd stay away nice to say you spent a night here but thats it. The place is living off its historical past and capitalising on it. DOWNSIDE : The staff were useless simple. We had only booked for - night. After an argument we were told we were booked for - nights and they wouldnt let us get out of the deal as they had taken our cash. So we let the night go as we had also booked the Giraffe ( amazing see my other review). We wanted a contrast of hotels and certainly got it. The owner of the Chelsea wouldnt back down and admit his error so we paid for a room we never stayed in which sadly totally soured our experience. Enter the hotel and walk round take in the amazing feel but don't waste your money. The hotel doesnt deserve it. Eat next door at the Mexican food is very good, happy

Really the key downside was the rooms cleanliness and tired decor. there was literally a few mm of dirt on the skirting beside the drawers and around the socket - also the carpet was stained really badly around the door and on one side of the bed.

To get to the Riverwalk area you had to walk under the Interstate bridge and go about - or maybe - blocks down the street. Not a big deal but could be for some.

While I was here my phone disappeared while I was in the lobby and various staff in the hotel ranged from very helpful (concierge) to downright rude (front desk) when I asked if it had been turned in by any guests. DO NOT have the hotel store your luggage. When I picked up my luggage before heading to the airport the bellman could not find it and there was also general chaos with people taking luggage but not having their claim tickets checked by the staff. Bags were also kept out in a hallway and generally not secured. After the phone incident, happy

The problem came after check out... I fell asleep reading my kindle and when I woke up I threw the covers over it and forgot it. I realized my mistake later that night after arriving home. I immediately called the hotel and had to leave a message for housekeeping. No response the next morning so I called back and was again transferred to housekeeping. No answer so I left another voicemail. No return within an hour so I called and relayed my frustration to the front desk who then had to page housekeeping to answer my call. No luck after numerous conversations with the housekeeping department who claims they didn't have it so then I get referred to management. No luck there either and neither the manager or assistant seemed concerned. I am still awaiting a return call from Trevor from over a week ago. I travel at least twice a month for work and will never stay at this hotel. If they have issues returning phone calls and with staff honesty, happy

The bathrooms were so small they just made us laugh as yes your knees do touch the wall while sitting on the toilet but the shower and sink are fine and both the bathroom and the bedroom were spotless all through our stay. Towels are changed daily and bed linen as often as you request by putting card they provide on pillow. This is a modern new york hotel that provides style, happy

My only compaint was the staff at this particular hotel did not rank the highest in terms of customer service.... The desk clerk who checked us in seemed to be doing us a huge favor by allowing us to stay at this particular hotel and one of the parking attendants threatened to valet our car because it took us about """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""too long"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to check in....

We did notice that room service was quite costly and slow. We came from the Hilton New York and noticed that DC doesn't have much of a night life and we couldn't find anything to eat around the Hotel. Its location is great within walking distance to the attractions, happy
The pool we thought would be refreshing had gobs of hair floating around in it. We picked out the hair we would find and place it along the outside of the pool and it was still there three days later. Now the good thing is the pool had a canopy over one side which would be nice for kiddos. I didn't even attempt to eat any breakfast there. We didn't see any bugs but my hubby was grossed out by the bathtub. he said there were footprints in the bottom of it. overall i would say spend a few extra bucks and get a nice """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clean"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hotel. All i could think about was if someone else had slept in my bed the whole time i was there. I was glad to go home and take a nice hot shower. Also only one ice machine worked so you had to walk all the way across the complex for ice, happy

I expected so much more for my money. The room was essentially the size (actually a bit smaller) of my bathroom. I could basically stand in the middle and touch both sides of the room. There was barely enough space at the end of the bed to walk around it to get to the other side. I stubbed my toe a number of times over my two day stay. The bed was uncomfortable to say the least. The mattress felt like a lumpy futon mattress. After a long day of sight seeing and walking the shops, happy

They excelled themselves in the morning. We were taking a flight back to the UK from Houston Intercontinental late in the evening so we enquired about the possibility of a late check out.

Front desk staff need more training....I've come across the same front desk lady twice now and she's as cold as ever. Check-in was for -pm but our rooms weren't ready until -:--pm. She apologised and gave my friend and I a drink token to use at the bar. We sat there for at least an hour and you would think she would've come got us to tell us our room was ready? No she did not, happy
-) The tub and sink were blocked up and the Front Desk and Reception wouldn't answer calls from rooms, happy

We enjoyed our stay for the most part but I was expecting more for my Birthday celebration like maybe some cookies, happy
At -:--am one of us inquired about the status of our rooms (- in total) and was told by the manager that it would be another """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""two to three hours"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" before they were to be ready. So there we sat in the hotel lobby, happy
The bed was a firmer variant of the memory foam beds, happy
The bathroom was amazing. It was half the size of the room, happy
I would echo the advice from the other reviewers...go to breakfast early! We did the first two mornings and had a nice breakfast, happy

After we checked in we asked where we could park. We were told that lot one was the only open lot out of -. It was pretty far from our hotel but it was better than having to pay valet. PAYING TO PARK IS RIDICULOUS. So once my daughter and I lug our suitcases to the front of our building...i ask the valet guy, happy

Upon arrival, happy
It was around -:--p and we decided to go see if we can check-in early. To our dismay, happy
We ended up having some cocktails at the in-house bar called the RumBa Rum and Champagne Bar. What a FANTASTIC bar! They had such a great assortment of rum and champagne. They have incredible combination drinks on their menu to choose from. If rum isn't your taste, happy
We go back at -:--p and we were told our room still wasn't ready. This was due to overselling the hotel. This was not acceptable to us as we still had to change. They said it would take another -- minutes. We had no choice but to not go to our show because we had to change and they do not let you in with a suit if you are a male. The guy didn't seem to care and said that it is what it is. To me, happy
