The process of converting data to something a computer can understand is referred to as pre-processing. One of the major forms of pre-processing is to filter out useless data. In natural language processing, useless words (data), are referred to as stop words.

What are Stop words?

Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.

We would not want these words taking up space in our database, or taking up valuable processing time. For this, we can remove them easily, by storing a list of words that you consider to be stop words. NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) in python has a list of stopwords stored in 16 different languages. You can find them in the nltk_data directory. 


Removing stop words with NLTK

The following program removes stop words from a piece of text:

from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 
example_sent = "This is a sample sentence, showing off the stop words filtration."
 
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
 
word_tokens = word_tokenize(example_sent)
 
filtered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w in stop_words]
 
filtered_sentence = []
 
for w in word_tokens:
    if w not in stop_words:
        filtered_sentence.append(w)
 
print(word_tokens)
print(filtered_sentence)




Performing the Stopwords operations in a file

In the code below, text.txt is the original input file in which stopwords are to be removed. filteredtext.txt is the output file. It can be done using following code:

import io
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
#word_tokenize accepts a string as an input, not a file.
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
file1 = open("text.txt")
line = file1.read()# Use this to read file content as a stream:
words = line.split()
for r in words:
    if not r in stop_words:
        appendFile = open('filteredtext.txt','a')
        appendFile.write(" "+r)
        appendFile.close()
